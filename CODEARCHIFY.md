### `# üèó Architecture Documentation`

#### `## üìñ Context`

This repository contains an AWS CDK project for deploying a Lambda function extension using the AWS Well-Architected Framework. The extension is designed to send telemetry data to an Amazon Kinesis stream.

The main components of this project include:

* AWS CDK project
* Lambda function extension
* Amazon Kinesis stream

#### `## üìñ Overview`

The architecture consists of a Lambda function extension that listens for telemetry data and sends it to an Amazon Kinesis stream. The extension is deployed using AWS CDK.

| Component | Description | Interacts With | Purpose |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------- |
| AWS CDK Project | Manages the infrastructure deployment | Lambda function extension, Amazon Kinesis stream | Orchestrates the deployment of the Lambda function extension and Amazon Kinesis stream |
| Lambda function extension | Listens for telemetry data and sends it to Amazon Kinesis | AWS CDK project, Amazon Kinesis | Receives telemetry data and sends it to the Amazon Kinesis stream |
| Amazon Kinesis stream | Stores and processes telemetry data | Lambda function extension | Receives and processes telemetry data from the Lambda function extension |

#### `## üîÑ Data Flow`

| Source | Destination | Data Type | Flow Description |
| ------ | ----------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Lambda function extension | Amazon Kinesis stream | Telemetry data | The Lambda function extension sends telemetry data to the Amazon Kinesis stream |

#### `## üß± Technologies`

| Category | Technology | Purpose |
| -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Infrastructure | AWS CDK | Deploys and manages infrastructure as code |
| Compute | AWS Lambda | Runs the Lambda function extension |
| Data Processing | Amazon Kinesis | Stores and processes telemetry data |

#### `## üìù Codebase Evaluation`

The codebase follows best practices for AWS CDK, Lambda functions, and Amazon Kinesis. The following improvements could be made:

* Use environment variables or Secrets Manager for storing sensitive information like AWS region and extension name.
* Use a separate Lambda layer for the extension code to improve code reusability and maintainability.
* Use a more descriptive name for the Lambda function.
* Use a more descriptive name for the Kinesis stream.

#### `## üìö Output Summary`

* Steps completed:
  * Analyzed the purpose of the repository.
  * Identified the main components and their interactions.
  * Provided a high-level architectural view.
  * Created a Mermaid diagram.
* Pending areas to be analyzed or documented:
  * None at this time.
* Assumptions or open questions:
  * The codebase follows AWS best practices and the Well-Architected Framework.
  * The telemetry data is properly formatted and can be serialized to JSON.
  * The extension is designed to handle errors and retries when sending data to Amazon Kinesis.
