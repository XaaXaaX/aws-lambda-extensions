# üèó Architecture Documentation

## Context

The provided source code appears to be an AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) application that sets up an AWS Lambda extension for processing telemetry data from a Kinesis stream. The extension is designed to receive and process events from the Lambda runtime, and then dispatch the events to the Kinesis stream.

The key services, APIs, and tools used in this application include:

- AWS CDK: Used for defining the infrastructure as code.
- AWS Lambda: The serverless compute service used to run the extension.
- AWS Kinesis: The managed streaming service used to store the telemetry data.
- AWS SSM (Systems Manager): Used to store the ARN of the Lambda extension and the managed policy.
- AWS IAM: Used to define the managed policy for the Lambda extension.
- Undici: An HTTP client used to handle the HTTP requests and responses for the extension.
- AWS SDK for JavaScript: Used to interact with AWS services (Kinesis, Lambda, IAM, SSM).

## Overview

The architecture of this application can be described as follows:

- **Components and Responsibilities**:
  - **TelemetryApiKinesisExtensionStack**: The main CDK stack that sets up the necessary infrastructure, including the Kinesis stream, Lambda extension, and associated resources.
  - **TelemetryApiExtension**: The Lambda extension that receives events from the Lambda runtime, processes the telemetry data, and dispatches it to the Kinesis stream.
  - **TelemetryListener**: The component that starts the listener for the Lambda extension and manages the event queue.
  - **TelemetryDispatcher**: The component responsible for dispatching the telemetry data to the Kinesis stream.

- **Interactions**:
  - The Lambda extension registers itself with the Lambda runtime and subscribes to receive events.
  - When an event is received, the extension processes the telemetry data and dispatches it to the Kinesis stream.
  - The Kinesis stream is used to store the telemetry data for further processing or analysis.

- **Patterns**:
  - The application uses the Lambda extension pattern to integrate with the Lambda runtime and process telemetry data.
  - The application also uses the Kinesis stream to store the telemetry data, which can be considered a form of the event-driven architecture pattern.

The new code provided appears to be related to the `TelemetryListener` component, which is responsible for starting the listener for the Lambda extension and managing the event queue.

The key changes and additions are:

1. The `subscribe` function in the `TelemetryListener` module, which is responsible for subscribing the Lambda extension to the Lambda runtime and setting up the event listener.
2. The `dispatch` function in the `TelemetryDispatcher` module, which is responsible for dispatching the telemetry data to the Kinesis stream in batches.
3. The `start` function in the `TelemetryListener` module, which creates an HTTP server to receive the telemetry data from the Lambda runtime and adds it to the event queue.
4. The `telemetryLogModel` and related types, which define the structure of the telemetry data received from the Lambda runtime.

These changes and additions further enhance the functionality of the application by:

1. Providing a way to subscribe the Lambda extension to the Lambda runtime and set up the event listener.
2. Implementing a batching mechanism to dispatch the telemetry data to the Kinesis stream, which can improve performance and reduce the number of API calls.
3. Creating an HTTP server to receive the telemetry data from the Lambda runtime and manage the event queue.
4. Defining the structure of the telemetry data, which can help with processing and analysis.

Overall, the new code strengthens the architecture of the application by adding more robust event handling and data dispatching capabilities.# üèó Architecture Documentation

## üóíÔ∏è Architecture Summary

The provided code represents an AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) stack that deploys a Kinesis-based telemetry extension for a Lambda function. The key components and their interactions are as follows:

1. **TelemetryApiKinesisExtensionStack**: This is the main CDK stack that creates the necessary resources for the telemetry extension.
   - It creates a Kinesis stream named `telemetry-kinesis-stream` to store the telemetry data.
   - It creates a Lambda layer named `kinesis-telemetry-api-extension` that contains the extension code.
   - It creates a Lambda function named `${this.stackName}-temp-nodejs20-function` that uses the extension layer.
   - It creates an IAM managed policy named `${props?.extensionName}-runtime` that grants the necessary permissions to the Lambda function to interact with the Kinesis stream and CloudWatch logs.
   - It stores the ARNs of the extension layer and the IAM policy in SSM Parameter Store for later use.

2. **telemetry-api.ts**: This file contains the code for the telemetry extension, which is responsible for registering the extension with the Lambda runtime, receiving events, and dispatching telemetry data to the Kinesis stream.
   - The `register()` function registers the extension with the Lambda runtime.
   - The `next()` function retrieves the next event from the Lambda runtime.
   - The `subscribe()` function subscribes the extension to receive telemetry data from the Lambda runtime.

3. **telemetry-dispatcher.ts**: This file contains the code for dispatching the telemetry data to the Kinesis stream.
   - The `sendsToKinesis()` function sends the telemetry data to the Kinesis stream.

4. **telemetry-listener.ts**: This file contains the code for the telemetry listener, which receives the telemetry data from the Lambda runtime and adds it to a queue.
   - The `start()` function starts the telemetry listener and returns the listener URI.
   - The `eventsQueue` property holds the queue of telemetry events.

5. **extensions-api.ts**: This file contains the code for interacting with the Lambda runtime extension API.
   - The `register()` function registers the extension with the Lambda runtime.
   - The `next()` function retrieves the next event from the Lambda runtime.

The overall architecture consists of a Lambda function that uses the telemetry extension to collect and dispatch telemetry data to a Kinesis stream. The extension is deployed as a Lambda layer, and the necessary permissions are granted to the Lambda function through an IAM managed policy.

## üîë Key Design Decisions

1. **Kinesis Stream**: The use of a Kinesis stream to store the telemetry data provides a scalable and durable solution for handling the telemetry data.
2. **Lambda Layer**: The telemetry extension is deployed as a Lambda layer, which allows for easy reuse and versioning of the extension code.
3. **IAM Managed Policy**: The use of an IAM managed policy to grant the necessary permissions to the Lambda function ensures that the permissions are centrally managed and can be easily updated if needed.
4. **SSM Parameter Store**: Storing the ARNs of the extension layer and the IAM policy in the SSM Parameter Store allows for easy retrieval and use of these values in other parts of the application.
5. **Telemetry Listener and Dispatcher**: The separation of the telemetry listener and dispatcher components allows for better modularity and testability of the code.

## üß† Potential Improvements

1. **Error Handling**: The code could be improved by adding more robust error handling, such as retrying failed Kinesis record submissions and handling other potential errors that may occur during the extension's execution.
2. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implementing monitoring and alerting mechanisms, such as CloudWatch alarms, could help detect and respond to issues with the telemetry extension or the Kinesis stream.
3. **Performance Optimization**: The code could be analyzed for potential performance bottlenecks, such as the Kinesis client configuration or the buffer size and timeout settings, and optimized accordingly.
4. **Automated Testing**: Implementing automated tests, such as unit tests and integration tests, could help ensure the reliability and maintainability of the telemetry extension.
5. **Deployment Automation**: Automating the deployment of the telemetry extension, such as through a CI/CD pipeline, could improve the consistency and reliability of the deployment process.

## üóíÔ∏è Updated Architecture Summary

The new code provided adds additional functionality to the telemetry extension, specifically related to the telemetry listener and dispatcher components.

1. **telemetry-listener.ts**:
   - The `start()` function now creates an HTTP server that listens for POST requests on the specified host and port.
   - When a POST request is received, the `onLogReceived()` function is called, which parses the request body and adds the telemetry data to the `eventsQueue`.

2. **telemetry-dispatcher.ts**:
   - The `dispatch()` function now checks the length of the `pendingItems` array and dispatches the telemetry data to the Kinesis stream if the array length meets the `MAX_BATCH_RECORDS_ITEMS` threshold or if the `immediate` parameter is set to `true`.
   - The function creates a copy of the `pendingItems` array, removes the dispatched items from the original array, and then sends the data to the Kinesis stream using the `kinesis.sendsToKinesis()` function.

These updates enhance the telemetry extension by providing a dedicated listener component to receive and queue the telemetry data, and a dispatcher component to efficiently send the data to the Kinesis stream in batches. This separation of concerns improves the modularity and testability of the codebase.

## üîë Updated Key Design Decisions

6. **Telemetry Listener**: The addition of the telemetry listener component, which receives and queues the telemetry data, improves the overall architecture by separating the concerns of data reception and data dispatch.
7. **Telemetry Dispatcher**: The telemetry dispatcher component, which sends the telemetry data to the Kinesis stream in batches, helps optimize the performance and efficiency of the telemetry data processing.

## üß† Updated Potential Improvements

6. **Backpressure Handling**: The current implementation of the telemetry listener and dispatcher may not handle high-volume telemetry data effectively. Implementing backpressure mechanisms, such as limiting the size of the `eventsQueue` or using a bounded buffer, could help prevent data loss and improve the overall reliability of the system.
7. **Asynchronous Dispatching**: The current synchronous dispatching of telemetry data to the Kinesis stream may impact the performance of the Lambda function. Exploring asynchronous dispatching mechanisms, such as using a message queue or a serverless workflow, could help decouple the telemetry processing from the main Lambda function execution.# üèó Architecture Documentation

## üóÉÔ∏è Components

### AWS Lambda Function
- The Lambda function is responsible for processing and sending telemetry data to the Kinesis stream.
- The function is written in Node.js and uses the `aws-sdk` and `undici` libraries.
- The function is deployed as a Lambda layer, which can be used by other Lambda functions.
- The function is configured to use the latest Node.js runtime (currently 22.x).
- The function logs its activity to CloudWatch Logs for debugging and monitoring purposes.

### AWS Kinesis Stream
- The Kinesis stream is used to store the telemetry data sent by the Lambda function and the Kinesis dispatcher.
- The stream is configured with a single shard and a retention period of 1 day.
- The stream is set to be automatically deleted when the stack is deleted, to avoid leaving unused resources.

### AWS IAM
- The Lambda function is granted the necessary permissions to write to the Kinesis stream and to create and write to CloudWatch Logs.
- These permissions are managed through an IAM managed policy, which is attached to the Lambda function's execution role.
- The policy allows the `kinesis:PutRecord`, `kinesis:PutRecords`, `logs:CreateLogGroup`, `logs:CreateLogStream`, and `logs:PutLogEvents` actions.

### AWS SSM Parameter Store
- Two parameters are stored in the SSM Parameter Store:
  1. The ARN of the Lambda layer that contains the telemetry extension.
  2. The ARN of the IAM managed policy that grants the necessary permissions to the Lambda function.
- These parameters can be used by other parts of the system to access the telemetry extension and its associated permissions.

### Lambda Extension
- The Lambda extension is responsible for collecting and sending telemetry data to the HTTP listener.
- The extension subscribes to the Telemetry API to receive function invocation events.
- The extension sends the collected telemetry data to the HTTP listener running on the local machine.

### HTTP Listener
- The HTTP listener is a local server that receives the telemetry data from the Lambda extension.
- The listener processes the received data and passes it to the Kinesis dispatcher for further processing.
- The listener is running on the local machine, listening on the `sandbox:4243` endpoint.

### Kinesis Dispatcher
- The Kinesis dispatcher is responsible for batching and sending the telemetry data to the Kinesis stream.
- The dispatcher receives the telemetry data from the HTTP listener and buffers it until a certain threshold is reached (e.g., maximum number of items or timeout).
- The dispatcher then sends the batched data to the Kinesis stream.

## üîç Observability

- The Lambda function logs its activity to CloudWatch Logs, which can be used for debugging and monitoring purposes.
- The Kinesis stream can be monitored using CloudWatch metrics, such as the number of records put, the number of failed records, and the stream's capacity utilization.
- The HTTP listener and the Kinesis dispatcher can log their activity to help with debugging and monitoring the overall system.

## üîí Security

- The Lambda function is granted the minimum necessary permissions to perform its tasks, using the IAM managed policy.
- The Kinesis stream is set to be automatically deleted when the stack is deleted, to avoid leaving unused resources.
- The Lambda function uses the `undici` library to configure the HTTP agent with appropriate timeouts, to ensure reliable connections to the Kinesis stream.
- The HTTP listener is running on the local machine and is not exposed to the internet, which helps to mitigate potential security risks.

## üöÄ Deployment

- The entire architecture is defined as an AWS CDK stack, which can be deployed using the AWS CDK CLI.
- The stack includes the Lambda function, the Kinesis stream, the IAM managed policy, and the SSM parameters.
- The Lambda function's code is packaged as a Lambda layer, which can be easily updated and deployed independently of the stack.
- The Lambda extension is also packaged as a separate component, which can be deployed and updated independently.
- The HTTP listener and the Kinesis dispatcher are part of the Lambda extension and are deployed together with the extension.# üèó Architecture Documentation
