## ðŸ“– Context
* Explain the goal of the repository:
    - The repository aims to provide a Telemetry API Extension for Kinesis push, allowing for the integration of telemetry data with Amazon Kinesis streams.
* Identify used services or notable code libraries:
    - AWS CDK for infrastructure provisioning.
    - AWS services like Kinesis, Lambda, IAM, SSM for managing telemetry data.
    - Undici for HTTP client.
    - @aws-sdk/client-kinesis for interacting with Amazon Kinesis.
    - @smithy/node-http-handler for handling HTTP requests.
    - Node.js for server-side logic.

## ðŸ“– Overview
* The architecture involves setting up a Telemetry API Extension for Kinesis push using AWS CDK.
* Key components include Kinesis stream, Lambda functions, IAM policies, LayerVersion, LogGroup, and StringParameter.
* The system interacts through API calls between Lambda functions, Kinesis stream, and external services.
* Design patterns like event-driven architecture and serverless computing are utilized.
* The new code chunk introduces functionalities for subscribing to the extension, dispatching telemetry data to Kinesis, and setting up an HTTP server for receiving telemetry logs.

## ðŸ”¹ Components
