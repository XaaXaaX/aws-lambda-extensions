# Output Format

## ðŸ“– Context
The provided code appears to be a part of an AWS Lambda extension that integrates with the AWS Kinesis data stream. The extension is designed to capture and send telemetry data from the Lambda function to the Kinesis stream. This extension can be used to enhance the observability and monitoring capabilities of the Lambda function by providing a centralized location for collecting and analyzing telemetry data.

The code includes the following notable services and libraries:
- AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) for infrastructure as code
- AWS Kinesis for data streaming
- AWS Lambda for serverless computing
- AWS SSM (Systems Manager) for storing parameter values
- AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) for managing permissions
- Undici for HTTP client functionality

## ðŸ“– Overview
The architecture of this system consists of the following key components:

1. **TelemetryApiKinesisExtensionStack**: This is the main AWS CDK stack that defines the infrastructure for the Kinesis telemetry extension. It creates the following resources:
   - Kinesis data stream
   - Lambda function layer for the telemetry extension
   - Lambda function that acts as the entry point for the extension
   - IAM managed policy to grant the necessary permissions for the extension to interact with Kinesis and CloudWatch Logs

2. **Telemetry API Extension**: This is the core of the extension, responsible for registering with the Lambda runtime, receiving events, and dispatching telemetry data to the Kinesis stream.

3. **Telemetry Listener**: This component is responsible for starting a local HTTP server to receive telemetry data from the Lambda function and adding it to an in-memory queue.

4. **Telemetry Dispatcher**: This component is responsible for periodically flushing the telemetry data from the in-memory queue to the Kinesis stream.

The overall architecture follows an event-driven design, where the Lambda function extension receives events from the Lambda runtime, processes them, and dispatches the telemetry data to the Kinesis stream. The extension uses the AWS Lambda Extensions API to integrate with the runtime and the AWS SDK for Kinesis to interact with the data stream.

The architecture leverages several AWS services and libraries to provide a robust and scalable solution for collecting and storing telemetry data from Lambda functions. The use of AWS CDK for infrastructure as code ensures that the deployment and management of the extension is streamlined and consistent across different environments.

## New Code Analysis

The new code provided appears to be the implementation of the `Telemetry Listener` component, which is responsible for starting a local HTTP server to receive telemetry data from the Lambda function and adding it to an in-memory queue.

The key aspects of this component are:

1. **Listener Setup**: The `start()` function creates an HTTP server that listens on the `LISTENER_HOST` and `LISTENER_PORT` (default is `sandbox:4243`). This server is designed to receive POST requests and handle the incoming telemetry data.

2. **Telemetry Data Processing**: The `onLogReceived()` function is called when the HTTP server receives a POST request. It takes the incoming telemetry data (in the form of `telemetryLogModel` objects) and adds the message payload to the `eventsQueue` array.

3. **Event Queue Management**: The `eventsQueue` array is used to store the incoming telemetry data in memory. This queue will be processed by the `Telemetry Dispatcher` component to send the data to the Kinesis stream.

This component plays a crucial role in the overall architecture by providing a way to receive and buffer the telemetry data from the Lambda function before it is dispatched to the Kinesis stream. The in-memory queue helps to optimize the data transfer and ensure that no telemetry data is lost during the dispatch process.

The integration of this `Telemetry Listener` component with the `Telemetry API Extension` and the `Telemetry Dispatcher` components completes the end-to-end flow of the telemetry data collection and processing within the overall architecture.

The addition of the `Telemetry Listener` component, which uses the built-in Node.js `http` module to create a local HTTP server, enhances the overall architecture by providing a dedicated mechanism for receiving and buffering the telemetry data before it is dispatched to the Kinesis stream. This design decision helps to improve the reliability and scalability of the telemetry data collection process.
