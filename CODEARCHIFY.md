Overall, the codebase demonstrates a well-designed and scalable architecture that adheres to the principles of the Well-Architected Framework.

## New Code Analysis

The new code provided appears to be a part of the telemetry extension component. It includes the following functionality:

1. **subscribe**: This function is responsible for subscribing the extension to the Lambda runtime. It sends a subscription request to the Lambda runtime and handles the response, logging any issues.

2. **dispatch**: This function is responsible for dispatching the collected telemetry data to the Kinesis stream. It batches the telemetry data and sends it to the Kinesis client when the batch size reaches a certain threshold or when the function is called with the `immediate` flag set to `true`.

3. **Telemetry Listener**: This component starts an HTTP server that listens for incoming telemetry data. When data is received, it is added to the `eventsQueue` for further processing.

The new code integrates well with the existing architecture and follows the same design principles. The `subscribe` function ensures that the extension is properly registered with the Lambda runtime, while the `dispatch` function handles the efficient sending of telemetry data to the Kinesis stream.

The Telemetry Listener component provides a way to receive and process the telemetry data, which can then be used by the Telemetry Dispatcher to send the data to the Kinesis stream.

Overall, the new code aligns with the existing architecture and contributes to the overall functionality of the telemetry extension.\n# 🏗 Architecture Documentation

## 🔄 Data Flow

The data flow within the system can be summarized as follows:

| Source | Destination | Data Type | Flow Description |
| ------ | ----------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Lambda Runtime | Telemetry Listener | Telemetry Events | The Lambda runtime sends telemetry events to the local Telemetry Listener. |
| Telemetry Listener | Telemetry Dispatcher | Telemetry Events | The Telemetry Listener buffers the received telemetry events and passes them to the Telemetry Dispatcher. |
| Telemetry Dispatcher | Amazon Kinesis | Telemetry Data | The Telemetry Dispatcher sends the buffered telemetry data to the Amazon Kinesis stream. |

## Overview

The new code provided focuses on the implementation of the Telemetry Dispatcher component, which is responsible for sending the buffered telemetry data to the Amazon Kinesis stream.

## Components

1. **Telemetry Dispatcher**:
   - The `dispatch` function is responsible for dispatching the buffered telemetry data to the Kinesis stream.
   - It checks if the number of pending items has reached the `MAX_BATCH_RECORDS_ITEMS` threshold or if the `immediate` flag is set, and then sends the data to the Kinesis stream using the `kinesis.sendsToKinesis` function.
   - The function ensures that the pending items are cleared after successful dispatch.

2. **Kinesis**:
   - The `kinesis.sendsToKinesis` function is responsible for sending the telemetry data to the Amazon Kinesis stream.
   - It uses the AWS SDK to interact with the Kinesis service and send the data.
   - The function handles any errors that may occur during the data dispatch process and retries the operation if necessary.

## Technologies

The new code introduces the following additional technologies:

- **Undici**: An HTTP/1.1 client used for making HTTP requests, which is likely used in the `kinesis.sendsToKinesis` function to interact with the Kinesis service.

## Data Flow

The data flow remains the same as in the previous iteration, with the Telemetry Dispatcher now responsible for sending the buffered telemetry data to the Amazon Kinesis stream.

## Diagrams

No new diagrams are provided, as the overall architecture remains the same as in the previous iteration.

## Codebase Evaluation

The new code focuses on the implementation of the Telemetry Dispatcher component, which is a crucial part of the overall architecture. The code appears to be well-structured and follows best practices, such as:

- Checking the batch size before dispatching the data to the Kinesis stream, to optimize the number of requests.
- Handling errors and retrying the dispatch process if necessary, to ensure reliable data delivery.
- Clearing the pending items after successful dispatch, to maintain a clean state.

The integration with the Kinesis service using the AWS SDK is also well-implemented, demonstrating a solid understanding of the underlying AWS services and their usage.

Overall, the new code further strengthens the quality and robustness of the telemetry extension functionality.\n# 🏗 Architecture Documentation

## Context
The provided code represents an extension to the previous serverless AWS CDK application that sets up a Kinesis stream and a Lambda function with a custom runtime extension. The new code focuses on the implementation of the custom runtime extension, specifically the subscription and dispatch mechanisms for telemetry data.

## Overview
The application now includes the following additional components:

1. **Subscription Management**: The `subscribe` function in the `telemetry-api.ts` file is responsible for subscribing the custom runtime extension to the Lambda runtime. It sends a subscription request to the Lambda runtime and handles the response.
2. **Telemetry Dispatch**: The `dispatch` function in the `kinesis.ts` file is responsible for batching and dispatching the telemetry data to the Kinesis stream. It ensures that the data is sent in batches of up to 5 records to optimize performance.
3. **Telemetry Listener**: The `start` function in the `listener.ts` file sets up an HTTP server that listens for incoming telemetry data. When data is received, it is added to the `eventsQueue` for further processing.

## Components
1. **Subscription Management**: The `subscribe` function in the `telemetry-api.ts` file handles the subscription of the custom runtime extension to the Lambda runtime. It sends a subscription request and processes the response, ensuring the extension is properly registered.
2. **Telemetry Dispatch**: The `dispatch` function in the `kinesis.ts` file is responsible for batching and dispatching the telemetry data to the Kinesis stream. It ensures that the data is sent in batches of up to 5 records to optimize performance.
3. **Telemetry Listener**: The `start` function in the `listener.ts` file sets up an HTTP server that listens for incoming telemetry data. When data is received, it is added to the `eventsQueue` for further processing.

## Technologies
The technologies used in this application remain the same as the previous iteration:
- **AWS CDK**: The application is built using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), which allows for infrastructure as code (IaC) using TypeScript.
- **AWS Lambda**: The application uses AWS Lambda to execute the custom runtime extension.
- **AWS Kinesis**: The application uses AWS Kinesis to store the telemetry data.
- **Node.js**: The custom runtime extension is implemented in Node.js.

## Data Flow
1. The Lambda function is invoked, triggering the custom runtime extension.
2. The custom runtime extension registers with the Lambda runtime by calling the `subscribe` function.
3. When an `INVOKE` event is received, the extension dispatches the telemetry data to the `eventsQueue`.
4. The `dispatch` function periodically checks the `eventsQueue` and sends the telemetry data to the Kinesis stream in batches.
5. When a `SHUTDOWN` event is received, the extension immediately dispatches any remaining telemetry data and exits.
