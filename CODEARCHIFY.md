# 🏗 Architecture Documentation

## 📖 Context
The provided code represents an AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) stack that deploys a Kinesis stream and a Lambda function with a custom runtime extension. The purpose of this architecture is to provide a telemetry extension for the Kinesis stream, allowing for the collection and processing of telemetry data.

The key components of this architecture are:
- **Kinesis Stream**: A managed AWS service for real-time data streaming and processing.
- **Lambda Function**: A serverless compute service that runs the telemetry extension code.
- **Runtime Extension**: A custom extension that integrates with the Lambda runtime to capture and process telemetry data.

## 📖 Overview
The architecture follows a serverless, event-driven approach, where the Lambda function with the runtime extension is responsible for capturing and dispatching telemetry data to the Kinesis stream.

The main components and their interactions are as follows:

1. **CDK Stack**: The `TelemetryApiKinesisExtensionStack` class is the entry point of the CDK application, which creates the necessary AWS resources, including the Kinesis stream, the Lambda function, and the runtime extension.
2. **Kinesis Stream**: The Kinesis stream is created to store the telemetry data. The stream is configured with a removal policy to destroy the stream when the stack is deleted.
3. **Runtime Extension**: The runtime extension is implemented as a Lambda layer, which is attached to the Lambda function. The extension is responsible for registering with the Lambda runtime, receiving events (such as `INVOKE` and `SHUTDOWN`), and dispatching the telemetry data to the Kinesis stream.
4. **Lambda Function**: The Lambda function is a simple Node.js function that logs the incoming event data. The function is configured to use the runtime extension layer.
5. **Telemetry Dispatcher**: The `telemetry-dispatcher` module is responsible for sending the collected telemetry data to the Kinesis stream.
6. **Telemetry Listener**: The `telemetry-listener` module is responsible for starting a listener that receives the telemetry data and adds it to a queue.
7. **Extensions API**: The `extensions-api` module provides functions to register the extension with the Lambda runtime and receive events from the runtime.
8. **Telemetry API**: The `telemetry-api` module provides a function to subscribe the extension to the telemetry listener.

## 🔍 Additional Analysis

The new code provided includes the following components:

1. **Telemetry Dispatcher**:
   - The `dispatch` function is responsible for sending the collected telemetry data to the Kinesis stream.
   - It checks if the pending items in the queue exceed the `MAX_BATCH_RECORDS_ITEMS` threshold or if the `immediate` flag is set, and then dispatches the data to the Kinesis stream.
   - The function uses the `kinesis` module to send the data to the Kinesis stream.

2. **Telemetry Listener**:
   - The `telemetry-listener` module sets up an HTTP server that listens for incoming telemetry data.
   - The `onLogReceived` function is called when the server receives a POST request with telemetry data, and it adds the data to the `eventsQueue`.
   - The `start` function creates the HTTP server and returns the listener URL.

3. **Types**:
   - The `telemetryLogModelRecord` and `telemetryLogModel` types define the structure of the telemetry data received by the listener.
   - The `Exception` type is a generic type for handling exceptions.

The new code enhances the overall architecture by providing the following additional functionality:

1. **Telemetry Dispatching**: The `Telemetry Dispatcher` module is responsible for sending the collected telemetry data to the Kinesis stream. It batches the data and sends it in a more efficient manner, reducing the number of individual requests to the Kinesis stream.

2. **Telemetry Listening**: The `Telemetry Listener` module sets up an HTTP server that listens for incoming telemetry data. This allows the runtime extension to send the collected telemetry data to the listener, which then adds it to a queue for dispatching.

3. **Telemetry Data Structure**: The new code defines the structure of the telemetry data, which includes the log record, timestamp, and event type. This ensures a consistent format for the telemetry data, making it easier to process and analyze.

## 📝 **Codebase Evaluation**

| Evaluation Metric | Status | Notes |
| ----------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Dependency & Coupling | ⚠️ | The codebase has a moderate level of dependency and coupling. It relies on several external libraries like `aws-sdk`, `undici`, and `telemetry-api`. While these dependencies are necessary for the functionality, the codebase could benefit from further modularization to reduce tight coupling between components. |
| Code Complexity | ⚠️ | The codebase has a reasonable level of complexity, with some functions and classes that could be further simplified or broken down into smaller, more focused units. The use of async/await and error handling could be improved to enhance readability and maintainability. |
| Cloud Anti-Patterns | ✅ | The codebase appears to follow best practices for Lambda development. It uses managed services like Kinesis and SSM Parameter Store, and it handles error cases and timeouts appropriately. However, there is room for improvement in terms of cost optimization and scalability. |

## 🔍 Recommendations

### Security, Cost, and Scalability

1. **Security**: The codebase does not appear to have any obvious security issues. However, it's recommended to review the IAM permissions granted to the Lambda function and the Kinesis stream to ensure the principle of least privilege is followed.

2. **Cost Optimization**: The codebase creates a Kinesis stream with a fixed shard count of 1. This may not be the most cost-effective approach, as the stream's capacity needs to be manually adjusted to handle varying loads. Consider implementing auto-scaling for the Kinesis stream to optimize costs.

3. **Scalability**: The codebase uses a single Lambda function to handle all incoming events. As the load increases, this approach may not scale well. Consider implementing a more scalable architecture, such as using a Lambda function per event type or a serverless event-driven architecture with multiple Lambda functions.

### Complexity Reduction

1. **Modularization**: The codebase could benefit from further modularization, separating concerns into smaller, more focused modules. This would improve code readability, maintainability, and testability.

2. **Error Handling**: The error handling in the codebase could be improved by using more specific error types and providing more detailed error messages. This would make it easier to diagnose and resolve issues.

3. **Logging and Observability**: The codebase could be enhanced by adding more detailed logging and observability features, such as capturing additional context information or integrating with a centralized logging solution.

## 🚀 Next Steps

Based on the evaluation and recommendations, the following next steps are suggested:

1. Refactor the codebase to improve modularization and reduce coupling between components.
2. Implement auto-scaling for the Kinesis stream to optimize costs.
3. Explore a more scalable architecture, such as using a Lambda function per event type or a serverless event-driven architecture.
4. Enhance the error handling and logging capabilities to improve observability and maintainability.

By addressing these areas, the codebase can be improved in terms of security, cost, scalability, and overall maintainability.
