# üèó Architecture Documentation

## üìñ Context

* This repository contains an AWS CDK project that provisions an AWS Lambda Extension for pushing telemetry data to an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream.
* The extension is designed to capture and forward logs and metrics from AWS Lambda functions to a Kinesis stream for further processing or analysis.
* It utilizes the AWS Lambda Extensions API to subscribe to telemetry events and the AWS SDK for Kinesis to send data to the stream.

## üìñ Overview

The key components of this architecture are:

1. **AWS CDK Stack**: Defines the infrastructure resources using AWS CDK constructs, including an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream, an AWS Lambda Layer containing the extension code, and an AWS Lambda function for testing purposes.

2. **Telemetry Extension**: A Node.js Lambda Extension that subscribes to Lambda telemetry events, buffers the data, and sends it to the Kinesis Data Stream.

3. **Kinesis Data Stream**: A scalable and durable real-time data streaming service that receives and stores the telemetry data from the extension.

The main flow is as follows:

1. The CDK stack provisions the required resources, including the Kinesis Data Stream and the Lambda Extension Layer.
2. When a Lambda function is invoked, the Telemetry Extension subscribes to telemetry events using the Lambda Extensions API.
3. The extension buffers the received telemetry data (logs, metrics, etc.) in memory.
4. At regular intervals or when the buffer reaches a certain size, the extension sends the buffered data to the Kinesis Data Stream using the AWS SDK for Kinesis.
5. The data in the Kinesis stream can be consumed by other services or applications for further processing, analysis, or storage.

## üìù Codebase Evaluation

### Code Quality & Architecture

- The codebase follows a modular structure, separating concerns into different files (e.g., `telemetry-api.ts`, `kinesis.ts`, `telemetry-listener.ts`).
- The use of AWS CDK for infrastructure provisioning promotes infrastructure as code and declarative resource management.
- The extension leverages the Lambda Extensions API, which is a recommended approach for extending Lambda functionality.
- The code could benefit from better error handling and logging practices.
- Potential improvements include implementing retries and backoff strategies for Kinesis operations and better handling of edge cases (e.g., when the Kinesis stream is not available).

### Security, Cost, and Operational Excellence

### Suggestions

**Security Posture**:

- Implement resource tagging for better visibility and cost allocation.
- Consider storing shared resource identifiers (e.g., Kinesis stream name) in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store for better security and maintainability.
- Implement proper error handling and logging practices to aid in troubleshooting and security incident response.

**Operational Efficiency**:

- Define log retention policies for the Lambda function and the Kinesis Data Stream to manage storage costs and comply with data retention requirements.
- Implement code quality checks (e.g., linting, unit testing) to ensure code maintainability and catch potential issues early.
- Consider implementing retries and backoff strategies for Kinesis operations to improve reliability and handle transient failures.

**Cost Optimization**:

- Configure appropriate memory and timeout settings for the Lambda function based on workload requirements to optimize costs.
- Monitor and adjust the Kinesis Data Stream's shard count based on actual throughput requirements to optimize costs.
- Implement cost allocation tags on resources for better cost tracking and optimization.

**Infrastructure Simplicity**:

- The current architecture is relatively simple and focused on a specific use case (telemetry data streaming).
- Consider separating the extension code from the CDK stack definition for better maintainability and reusability.
- Explore using AWS Lambda Destinations or AWS Lambda Event Source Mappings as alternative approaches to streaming telemetry data, potentially simplifying the architecture.
